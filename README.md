# Argus
A system monitoring experiment using [Blazor](https://blazor.net/) for the front end.

## Design Goals
This project aims to achieve the following:
 - create a working Blazor application during the experimental phase
 - test interop of various features with Blazor, e.g. SignalR
 - test security 
 - test hosting on Azure

## Argus

The project is named after [Argus Panoptes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Panoptes) 
from Greek Mythology, an all-seeing giant with many eyes.

It is a system monitor that watches various systems according to a configuration data.

It is not intended to go beyond an experiment at present.
